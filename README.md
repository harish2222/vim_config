# vim_config

It my Neovim config so don't set it up for vim cause vim doesn't support 'lua'
This Vim Script is only for windows
also for other os but if any error pops up delete the files and start from fresh
In windows the place where nvim init.vim have to place is `%USERPROFILE%\APPDATA\Local\nvim\`
and source the file
